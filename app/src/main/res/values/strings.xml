We are a force of 900 people with work spread across 23 states in India. Goonj has won many National and International awards including the Ramon Magsaysay award 2015 to our founder Anshu Gupta. The work has touched upon some difficult rural development issues like water, sanitation, infrastructure, agriculture, migration apart from sustained work in disaster-hit communities. Goonj receives tonnes of material annually from urban population. This material goes through storing, sorting and processing. Sorted material is converted into kits of reusable material. Goonj engages with local communities in far flung areas in rural India to get development work done in their community using their own local resources and manpower. Material packed in kits is used as a parallel currency and is given out as a reward for their efforts. Do visit our website www.goonj.org to know more.</string>
